fastavro
========

The current Python `avro` package is packed with features but dog slow.

On a test case of about 10K records, it takes about 14sec to iterate over all of
them. In comparison the JAVA `avro` SDK does it in about 1.9sec.

`fastavro` is less feature complete than `avro`, however it's much faster. It
iterates over the same 10K records in 2.9sec, and if you use it with PyPy it'll
do it in 1.5sec (to be fair, the JAVA benchmark is doing some extra JSON
encoding/decoding).

If the optional C extension (generated by `Cython`_) is available, then
`fastavro` will be even faster. For the same 10K records it'll run in about
1.7sec.

Usage
=====
::

    import fastavro as avro

    with open('weather.avro', 'rb') as fo:
        reader = avro.reader(fo)
        schema = reader.schema

        for record in reader:
            process_record(record)

You can also use the `fastavro` script from the command line to dump `avro`
files.
::

    fastavro weather.avro

By default fastavro prints one JSON object per line, you can use the `--pretty`
flag to change this.

You can also dump the avro schema::

    fastavro --schema weather.avro


Here's the full command line help

::

    usage: fastavro [-h] [--schema] [--codecs] [--version] [-p] [file [file ...]]

    iter over avro file, emit records as JSON

    positional arguments:
      file          file(s) to parse

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help    show this help message and exit
      --schema      dump schema instead of records
      --codecs      print supported codecs
      --version     show program's version number and exit
      -p, --pretty  pretty print json

Limitations
===========
* Support only iteration
    - No writing for you!
* No reader schema

Hacking
=======
As recommended by Cython, the C files output is distributed. This has the
advantage that the end user does not need to have Cython installed. However it
means that every time you change `fastavro/pyfastavro.py` you need to run
`make`.

For `make` to succeed you need both python and python3 installed, cython on both
of them. For `./test-install.sh` you'll need virtualenv_.
